There are some key pieces of information I need from both RISHI and from the user (all from facebook):

UPDATE: (8/6/2013) Rishi doesn't seem to do a lot on facebook - consider finishing this algorithm and expanding it to rando people

1. Full Name
2. Work
3. Education (current and past)
4. Current City
5. Hometown (Rishi's is Thane, we will change that to farmington)
6. Birthday (soulmates <3)
7. Gender (rishi <3's dem ladies)
8. Relationship Status (single plox)
9. Religion (++points if you're jain)
10. Apparently rishi has no political views oh well 

^This is all the "about me" section for Rishi

First iteration of application:

Check all those pieces of information from the user (up to 33%)
Check how many mutual friends the client has with rishi (up to 33%)
Check if they're in any photos with rishi? (33%)
